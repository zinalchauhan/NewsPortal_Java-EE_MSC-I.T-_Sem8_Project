                                                                                Air News is a English language daily newspaper in India. It is a leading Gujarati newspaper in the Indian states of Gujarat and Maharashtra with the average daily readership of 4.6 million as per Indian Readership Survey 2014. <br/><br/><br/>

It enables us to be at the forefront in providing latest and the breaking news at all hours. We always aim to cover each and every segment of the society not with standing their cast, religion, economic status and give due emphasis to all the adverse viewpoints.<br/><br/><br/>

On the social side it has been our endeavor to connect to the society on a person to person basis by drawing attention and highlighting the difficulties and limitations faced by the common man in order to pave way for discussions or policy formation with an aim of providing solutions in all the sectors and sections of the society.<br/><br/><br/>

We at "Air News" follow a kind of non aligned policy and concentrate only to provide the factual information without any prejudice to whom so ever may be in the ruling side. This eventually make us dear to the people who wish to have the facts straight without any maneuver to change the nature of information by blending it with individualistic viewpoints. The contrast between the news pages and the editorial section is sufficient enough to prove our this point.</h3>
